p Introducing Emblem.js: a new templating language
  that compiles to Handlebars.js

ul
  li Indentation-based (like Slim, HAML, etc.)
  li Compiles to Handlebars; full compatibility with
    both custom and built-in Handlebars helpers
  li Ember.js-friendly syntax and full compatibility
    with auto-updating functionality.

/ Emblem is HTML5-aware; Render HTML if a line starts with
  known HTML tag, else invoke HB helper or perform property lookup.
  These defaults are easily overridable when necessary.
ul
  = each people as |person|
    li = person.name

section.ember-features
  / easy, natural Ember bindAttr support
  h1 class=foo The class name of this element is bound to 'foo'
  p class={ isActive 'flashing' 'inactive' } A more complicated example

  / implicit Ember action handlers
  a click={ action 'doIt' } href="#" Hello

/ render Glimmer components
%MyComponent @text="Hello World"
